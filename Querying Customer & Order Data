--Here, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--Display some data from the JanSales table.
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20;

--Display the number of orders occured in January.
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--How many OF the January orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(product) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_ID;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), product, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '548 Lincoln St%'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS 'Number of Customers', 
AVG(price) * quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2;
